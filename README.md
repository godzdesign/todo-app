Today I started with the idea to build a Windows application with Javascript/HTML/CSS via Electron completely from scratch. I did some research and read through many websites to improve my knowledge. Like I said in my other repositories, I am a complete beginner. So if I say something that isn't correct/completely wrong... I am sorry. I am having a lot of fun learning JavaScript and all the surrounding things. Im feeling very motivated and I am going to keep pushing my self, to complete this project. (It is a to-do application.)
